[Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) is an open-source code editor built with the web for the web.

I am a great fan for "Close other tabs" and "Close tabs to the right" in browsers. Whenever i open a new tab, mostly i use these options. I am missing these feature in Brackets. So i created this extension to bring them to brackets.

This extension is having three options (Close Other, Close Top Files, Close Bottom Files). By default i have enabled "Close Others", if you want other two (Close Top and Close Bottom), open settings.json file and change them.

***Locate settings.json:***
1.Help -> Show Extensions Folder.
2.Navigate to user/close-others/settings.json.
